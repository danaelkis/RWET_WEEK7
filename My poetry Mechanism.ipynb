    "### MY POETRY STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. (Wikipedia). The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four contestants each show.\n",
    "The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my quest for raw materials, I found a CSV file with 200,000 Jeopardy questions /answers/categories and other information. After reading the file, I found so many beautiful \"expressions\"  and connection that I could make very fast using the categories names and the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Examples:  <br />\n",
    "AIRLINE TRAVEL, a butcher skies <br />\n",
    "WE OWN YOU, August! <br />\n",
    "BE FRUITFUL & MULTIPLY a trampoline <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "My new poetic form is going to combine answers, categories, and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers are short and precise, varying from names of movies to names of objects. Since these are answers in a popular trivia show, they all feel familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories are surprisingly varied from \"stiff\" subjects like 'HISTORY' followed by 'BE FRUITFUL & MULTIPLY' or 'NEWS TO ME'.Thinking about it was funny because I would never know what questions can be asked on a theme like 'NEWS TO ME'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amount of money is also important because it will determine the difficulty of the question and will give you an incentive to take a higher risk with the money.  And of course, whether you were correct or wrong. I like that dichotomy in trivia games, there is only one answer and there is only one winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "category: BOOKS FOR THE BRAVE <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "random amount (400) + \"Plus\"  <br />\n",
    "random amount (200)  + \"Minus\" <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Possibilities of answers: <br />\n",
    "hamster or Martin Luther <br />\n",
    "Marc Antony or Truth <br />\n",
    "Weightlifting or golf <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "A final Answer <br />\n",
    "gloss! + \"Success\"  / \"Fail\" <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "My poem is the game without the questions. By not using the questions I was able to create a pending question in the air. a question that you maybe will arise from this combination of information. \n",
    "I think after a few poems you can feel the randomness and the fact that it is coming from a data set.  it has its amusing moments. I think my structure isn't magical or open enough, it is predictable and strict with its rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "I havent used tracery but, i was able to upload a package by myself :) \n",
    "I used Pandas to read my CSV file after failing for almost a day read a JSON file.\n",
    "It was refreshing to write my code in a comfrtable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
